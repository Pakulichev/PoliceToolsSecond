## Script's history
Police Tools was founded in the end of 2017 year by Pavel Akulichev. The starting wasn't so perfect, but script quickly recruited new users. The most users came from script's rival - MVDHelper. However, our script was pinned on Advance RolePlay and now it's competing with other script equally. Nowadays script is developing and updating by Pavel. The big team are working hard, because we are liked by users. We'll continue to develop our script and, firstly, our common team.
